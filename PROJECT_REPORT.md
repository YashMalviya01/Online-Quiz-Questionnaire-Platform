## 4.2 Technology

<div align="center">

### ⚙️ **Technology Stack Deep Dive**

</div>

### 4.2.1 Frontend Technology Stack

#### ⚛️ Core Framework: React 18.2

React was chosen as the frontend framework for several compelling reasons:

**Advantages:**
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Promotes reusability and maintainability
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering and updates
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive library support and community
- **Declarative Syntax**: Easier to understand and debug
- **Hooks**: Modern state management without class components

**Key Features Utilized:**
- `useState`: Local component state management
- `useEffect`: Side effects and lifecycle management
- `useCallback` & `useMemo`: Performance optimization
- `useRef`: DOM access for face detection canvas
- `useContext`: Global state sharing
- Custom Hooks: Reusable logic extraction

#### State Management: Redux Toolkit

**Why Redux Toolkit:**
- Centralized state management for complex application state
- Simplified Redux configuration with less boilerplate
- Built-in Immer for immutable updates
- RTK Query for efficient data fetching (considered for future enhancement)

**State Structure:**
```javascript
{
  auth: { user, token, isAuthenticated },
  quiz: { currentQuiz, questions, timeRemaining },
  proctoring: { violations, isMonitoring },
  analytics: { performanceData, charts }
}
```

#### Routing: React Router DOM 6

**Features Used:**
- Nested routing for complex layouts
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Lazy loading for code splitting
- Navigation guards for proctoring enforcement

#### UI Component Library: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS

**Radix UI Benefits:**
- Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- Full keyboard navigation support
- WCAG 2.1 compliant
- Components: Dialog, DropdownMenu, Select, Tabs, Tooltip, RadioGroup

**Tailwind CSS Benefits:**
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Responsive design utilities
- Small production bundle with PurgeCSS

#### Computer Vision: face-api.js

**Implementation Details:**
- **Models Used**: SSD MobileNetV1 for face detection
- **Face Descriptor**: 128-dimensional vector for face recognition
- **Detection Frequency**: Every 2 seconds during quiz
- **Matching Threshold**: 0.6 (configurable)

**Technical Flow:**
```
1. Load TensorFlow models on page load
2. Capture video frame from webcam
3. Detect faces in frame
4. Extract face descriptors
5. Compare with reference descriptor
6. Calculate Euclidean distance
7. Trigger violation if mismatch
```

#### Code Editor: Monaco Editor

**Configuration:**
- Syntax highlighting for JavaScript, Python, Java, C++
- Theme: VS Code Dark+
- Features: IntelliSense, bracket matching, code folding
- Read-only mode for solution display

#### Charts: Recharts

**Chart Types Implemented:**
- Line charts for performance trends
- Bar charts for question difficulty comparison
- Pie charts for question type distribution
- Area charts for attempt analytics

---

### 4.2.2 Backend Technology Stack

#### Runtime: Node.js 18 LTS

**Selection Rationale:**
- JavaScript everywhere (frontend + backend)
- Non-blocking I/O for high concurrency
- NPM ecosystem with 2M+ packages
- Long-term support (LTS) for stability

#### Framework: Express.js 4

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
Routes → Controllers → Services → Models → Database
```

**Middleware Stack:**
1. `helmet`: Security headers
2. `cors`: Cross-origin resource sharing
3. `express.json()`: JSON body parsing
4. `morgan`: HTTP request logging
5. `express-rate-limit`: Rate limiting
6. Custom auth middleware: JWT verification
7. Error handling middleware

#### Database: MongoDB 8.5

**Schema Design Philosophy:**
- Embedded documents for one-to-few relationships (quiz → settings)
- References for one-to-many relationships (quiz → questions)
- Denormalization for performance (student name in results)

**Indexing Strategy:**
```javascript
// User model
userSchema.index({ email: 1 }, { unique: true });
userSchema.index({ username: 1 }, { unique: true });

// Quiz model
quizSchema.index({ createdBy: 1, isPublished: 1 });

// Result model
resultSchema.index({ student: 1, quiz: 1 });
resultSchema.index({ quiz: 1, score: -1 });
```

**Why MongoDB:**
- Flexible schema for diverse question types
- JSON-like documents match JavaScript objects
- Easy horizontal scaling with sharding
- Rich query language with aggregation pipeline
- Good performance for read-heavy workloads

#### ODM: Mongoose 8.5

**Features Utilized:**
- Schema validation with types and constraints
- Pre/post middleware hooks (e.g., password hashing)
- Virtual properties (e.g., fullName, duration)
- Population for referenced documents
- Custom instance and static methods

**Example Schema with Middleware:**
```javascript
userSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
  if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10);
  next();
});

userSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function(password) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};
```

#### Authentication: JWT + Passport.js

**Authentication Flow:**
```
1. User submits credentials
2. Validate credentials against database
3. Generate JWT token with user ID and role
4. Return token to client
5. Client includes token in Authorization header
6. Server verifies token on each request
7. Attach user to request object
```

**JWT Payload:**
```javascript
{
  id: user._id,
  role: user.role,
  iat: timestamp,
  exp: timestamp + 24h
}
```

**OAuth Integration:**
- Google OAuth 2.0 with Passport-Google-OAuth20
- Microsoft OAuth with Passport-Microsoft
- Automatic account creation or linking

#### Security Implementation

**Password Security:**
- Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds = 10
- Password complexity validation
- Account lockout after failed attempts (planned)

**Two-Factor Authentication:**
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using Speakeasy
- QR code generation with qrcode library
- 30-second validity window

**API Security:**
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Input validation with express-validator
- MongoDB injection prevention with express-mongo-sanitize
- XSS protection with Helmet
- CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

**Session Management:**
- Redis-backed sessions for scalability
- Session expiry: 24 hours
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

#### Real-Time Communication: WebSocket (ws)

**Proctoring WebSocket Flow:**
```
1. Student connects to WebSocket server
2. Server authenticates connection via JWT
3. Student joins quiz-specific room
4. Browser sends proctoring events:
   - Face detection results
   - Tab switch events
   - Copy-paste attempts
5. Server broadcasts to instructor dashboard
6. Server logs violations to database
```

**Message Format:**
```javascript
{
  type: 'PROCTORING_EVENT',
  quizId: '...',
  studentId: '...',
  eventType: 'TAB_SWITCH',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  data: { ... }
}
```

#### Email Service: Nodemailer

**Use Cases:**
- Password reset emails
- Quiz assignment notifications
- Result notifications
- Account verification (planned)

**Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  service: 'Gmail', // or SMTP
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
  }
}
```

#### Logging: Winston

**Log Levels:**
- `error`: Application errors
- `warn`: Warning conditions
- `info`: Informational messages
- `debug`: Debug information

**Transports:**
- Console: Development environment
- File: Production (logs/error.log, logs/combined.log)
- Rotation: Daily rotation to prevent large files

### 5.4.4 Corrective Actions Taken

| Issue Encountered | Corrective Action | Outcome |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| **High AI generation time (>60s)** | Implemented loading states, reduced default question count, added caching | User experience improved |
| **Face detection accuracy issues** | Added lighting guidelines, improved error messages, made it optional | More reliable proctoring |
| **WebSocket connection drops** | Implemented reconnection logic, better error handling | More stable real-time updates |
| **Large bundle size** | Implemented code splitting, lazy loading, tree shaking | Faster initial load |
| **Complex Docker setup** | Created automated setup scripts for all platforms | Easier deployment |
| **Inconsistent question quality** | Refined prompts, added validation, manual review option | Higher quality AI questions |

### 5.4.5 Lessons Learned

**Technical Lessons:**
1. **Prompt engineering is an art** - Iterative refinement was crucial for quality AI output
2. **Browser APIs have limitations** - Face detection quality varies across browsers
3. **WebSocket management is complex** - Reconnection and state synchronization require careful design
4. **Docker simplifies deployment** - Worth the initial setup effort
5. **Testing should start early** - Integration issues found late are costly

**Project Management Lessons:**
1. **Buffer time is essential** - 10-15% buffer saved the project timeline
2. **Scope creep is real** - Feature requests need prioritization
3. **Documentation takes time** - Should be continuous, not end-phase
4. **User feedback is valuable** - Early testing revealed UX issues
5. **Communication matters** - Regular team syncs prevented misalignment

**Best Practices Adopted:**
1. ✅ Version control with meaningful commits
2. ✅ Code reviews before merging
3. ✅ Consistent coding standards (ESLint, Prettier)
4. ✅ Environment-based configuration
5. ✅ Comprehensive error logging
6. ✅ API documentation (Postman collections)

### 5.4.6 Risk Management

| Risk Identified | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| **AI service downtime** | Implemented fallback to Gemini API | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Database corruption** | Daily backups, transaction logging | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | Regular dependency updates, security headers | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Performance degradation** | Implemented caching, database indexing | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Browser compatibility** | Tested on major browsers, graceful degradation | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Team member unavailability** | Documentation, knowledge sharing sessions | ✅ Mitigated |
